    info:
      - role: Full-Stack/Mobile Developer, DevOps
        time: 2020 - Present
        company: Abalia, Madrid
        details: |
          At Abalia, I’ve been deeply involved in the development and maintenance of large-scale applications.
          My main project, <a href="https://elser.es" target="_blank">Elser</a>, is a comprehensive web
          application for managing HR resources and assets, built using Java with Spring and Spring Boot on
          the backend, and JSF, PrimeFaces, and JoinFaces for the frontend. This platform handles everything
          from employee attendance and leave management to job candidate selection and outsourcing. It's a
          robust and highly active application, continually evolving with new features.

          In parallel, I am currently developing an alternative application to Elser, using a backend in
          Spring-Boot and a frontend with Angular. This is a greenfield project, built from scratch with
          Angular and a specialized backend, designed to be mobile-friendly and support reactive mode.

          I also developed the mobile version of Elser using Flutter, which replicates much of the web
          app’s functionality and is currently in beta on Google Play.

          Another major project I work on is <a href="https://hosteleo.com" target="_blank">Hosteleo</a>,
          a job search platform focused on the hospitality and tourism industries. I designed and
          implemented the entire backend using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, and integrated various
          third-party services like Stripe for payments, SendGrid for emails, and Google Cloud for hosting
          user files. Hosteleo serves hundreds of thousands of users and includes Google Ads management.

          In addition to these, I manage QA and testing for a web application called
          <a href="https://vission.omega.wizzie.dev/" target="_blank">Vission</a>, automating tests with
          Python and Selenium. I also lead the QA and testing process for Elser, using Playwright and Pytest
          with Python. Additionally, I handle DevOps tasks, including cloud hosting on Google Cloud for
          both Elser and Hosteleo, and oversee the release process for the Elser mobile app. My role has
          also involved smaller projects like database migrations from MySQL to PostgreSQL and managing
          WordPress services for both Hosteleo and Abalia.
      - role: Developer, DevOps, System Administrator
        time: 2018 - 2020
        company: University of Medical Sciences "Dr Faustino Pérez Hernández", Sancti Spíritus
        details: |
          At the University of Medical Sciences in Sancti Spíritus, I was responsible for the programming,
          network administration, and DevOps for the university’s cloud services. I worked extensively with
          Docker and Kubernetes to manage and deploy these services. My role involved writing tools in Python
          and Perl to support network and service administration, as well as developing applications like a
          virtual library and digital journal system using Java, Python, Perl, Bash, and PHP.

          I collaborated closely with engineering teams to integrate custom libraries and digital repositories
          into existing systems. I also defined network specifications to optimize performance, handled system
          upgrades, and ensured data integrity. Additionally, I maintained system security by installing necessary
          patches and updates to keep the services reliable and secure.
      - role: Software Engineer, System Network Administrator
        time: 2014 - 2017
        company: University of Sancti Spíritus "José Martí Pérez"
        details: |
          At the University of Sancti Spíritus, I was part of the application development team while also handling
          responsibilities under the IT and networks group. I developed and managed several key applications,
          including the university's thesis repository, the internal webmail client, and the digital journals
          for academic publications. My work extended to managing essential services like the university’s network,
          internet proxy, and mail servers, all hosted on Linux and Proxmox systems, which I fully administered.

          My role involved coding in languages like Java, Bash, Python, PHP, Perl, and C, with a focus on both
          software development and the security of the network and services. I also handled the physical
          installation and setup of servers when needed. I collaborated closely with the software development
          and testing teams to build secure, high-performance applications, and I documented processes for system
          monitoring, recovery, and optimization.

          Additionally, I taught programming courses and led competitive programming workshops, combining hands-on
          coding with theoretical knowledge to help students develop their skills. My work was centered on ensuring
          reliable, secure, and efficient operations across both software and hardware systems.
